# Floi
A Spike project to learn more about different Machine learning methods



## ToDo

- [x] Refactor the code in a Parser folder(sub-module)
- [x] Refactor the Parser sub-module as most of the classes share similarites
- [ ] Implement Kappa Statistics in main.swift to test efficiency of classifiers
- [x] Merge Classifier and BayesClassifier together
- [x] Merge the different 10 Fold cross validation functions in main.swift 
- [ ] Upgrade project to Swift 5
- [ ] Look into using Tensorflow Swift https://www.tensorflow.org/swift
